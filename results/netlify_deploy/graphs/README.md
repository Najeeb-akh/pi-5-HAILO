### 6. realtime_capability.png
**Real-Time Capability Achievement Chart**
- Color-coded visualization showing real-time achievement
- Green: Real-time capable (≥ 15 FPS)
- Red: Below real-time (< 15 FPS)

**Key Insights:**
- CPU: Only 0/5 models achieve real-time (ResNet50 at 6.7 is close but below threshold)
- Hailo: 5/5 models achieve real-time
- 100% real-time capability with Hailo acceleration
